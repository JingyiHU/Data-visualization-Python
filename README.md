# Visualising Geospatial data with Python

An overview of the Folium library to visualize Geospatial data


Data visualization is a broader term that describes an effort to help people understand the importance of data by placing it in a visual context. Patterns, trends, and correlations can be easily shown visually which otherwise might go unnoticed in textual data. It is a fundamental part of the data scientistâ€™s toolkit. Creating visualisations is pretty easy but creating good ones is much harder. It requires an eye for detail and a good amount of expertise to create visualisations which are simple yet effective. Powerful visualisation tools and libraries are available today which have redefined the meaning of visualisation.
